## Project Structure
- `src/step_definitions/`: Contains the step definitions for the Cucumber tests.
- `src/features/`: Contains the feature files for the Cucumber tests.
- `logs/`: Directory where request and response logs are stored.
- `reports/`: Directory where the test report is generated.

## Logging
Logs for each test run are stored in the `logs` directory. Each log file is named based on the test description.

## Test Report
After running the tests, an HTML report is generated in the `reports` directory. You can open this report in your browser to view the test results.

## Notes
